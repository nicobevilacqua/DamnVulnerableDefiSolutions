# Challenge #6 - Selfie

A new cool lending pool has launched! It's now offering flash loans of DVT tokens.

Wow, and it even includes a really fancy governance mechanism to control it.

What could go wrong, right ?

You start with no DVT tokens in balance, and the pool has 1.5 million. Your objective: take them all.
