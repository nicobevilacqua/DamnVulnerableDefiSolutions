# Challenge #4 - Side entrance

A surprisingly simple leading pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

This very simple lending pool has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

You must take all ETH from the lending pool.
