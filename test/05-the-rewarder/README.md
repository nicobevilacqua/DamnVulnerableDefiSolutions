# Challenge #5 - The rewarder

There's a pool offering rewards in tokens every 5 days for those who deposit their DVT tokens into it.

Alice, Bob, Charlie and David have already deposited some DVT tokens, and have won their rewards!

You don't have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most rewards for yourself.

Oh, by the way, rumours say a new pool has just landed on mainnet. Isn't it offering DVT tokens in flash loans?
